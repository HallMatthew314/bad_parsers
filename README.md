# bad_parsers

## WARNING: CURRENTLY NOT STABLE

This library's API is far from finalized, and different components can change or vanish without warning.
It is not currently recommended to use this library for any vaguely-serious projects.

## This README is very empty

I'm just getting basic things in order at the moment, this is a very green library.
If you need information on using the library, you can generate the documentation after cloning with `cargo doc --open`.
